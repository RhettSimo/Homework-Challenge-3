# Homework-Challenge-3
This repo contains files related to Rhett's work for the the third homework challenge in the UCB Coding Bootcamp course. There was a lot of fun involved in building this project, which happened ot be a password generator built in JavaScript for the most part. It was a fun project because there were a lot of interesting mechanics and stuff involved that we didn't really go over in the course all that well but this project helped me muddle my way through it and eventually come out with a better understanding of the module as a whole. It actaully is a surprisingly decent solution for people wondering how to get a randomized difficult-to-crack password for the various things they might need a password for. It let me delve deeper into "for" loops and functions in JavaScript as a whole.
